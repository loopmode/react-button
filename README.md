# react-button

## Temporarily deprecated :)

The idea was to build up a robust and reusable button component.
It started with the `AsyncState` wrapper.

However, since it turns out `AsyncState` is not only useful as a button wrapper, it became its own package `@loopmode/async-state`.
This `react-button` project is stale for now.
